# Game of life

## Rules

* Each live cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
* Each live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* Each live cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
* Each dead cell with three neighbors becomes populated.

## Done so far

* If live cell has one or no neighbors, it dies
* If live cell has two neighbors, it survives
